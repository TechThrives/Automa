# Automa

## Overview

Automa allows users to automate processes by defining **triggers** (events that start a workflow) and **actions** (tasks that are performed automatically once a trigger occurs). It is designed to be highly customizable, supporting multiple workflows and enabling the automation of complex processes.

## Technologies Used

- **Back-End**: Spring Boot
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Front-End**: React JS
- **OAuth 2.0**: Google OAuth for Google Actions integration
- **API Testing**: Postman
- **API Documentation**: Swagger

## Features

- **Trigger-based Automation**: Define specific triggers (e.g., time-based, event-based) that initiate workflows.
- **Flexible Actions**: Set up various types of actions such as sending emails, making API requests, updating databases, etc.
- **Google Account Integration**: Users can link their Google accounts to Automa to use Google Actions. This allows users to leverage Google's ecosystem for further automation, such as sending emails via Gmail, scheduling tasks, and more.
- **Cycle Prevention**: Prevent workflows from creating loops or cyclic dependencies.
- **Notification System**: Notify users about the status of their workflows, including successful executions, failures, or pending tasks.
- **Credits-based System**: A credit-based system for workflow executions where users can purchase credits to execute specific tasks or workflows.
- **Payment Gateway Integration**: Integration with payment gateways to allow users to buy credits using secure online transactions.

## Description

Automa simplifies the process of creating automated workflows by enabling users to set triggers that initiate actions. Users can visually build workflows, add conditions, and configure specific actions such as data transformations or notifications. This platform supports both simple automation tasks and more complex workflows involving multiple steps and dependencies.
